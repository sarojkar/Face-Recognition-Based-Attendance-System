# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
This project is all about the usage of face recognition technology. I have built face recognition based attendance system. 
This project is almost the new discovery ever seen in Nepalese schools and universities. This system is one-time based attendance system. 
This is an GUI application where admin can control overall system after verifying, he/she. The students need to be registered into the system first and then the system will recognize their faces and liberates their registered information like id, name, roll number and others info after recognizing them. 
The face of the students is recognized with the help of laptop web camera. The recognized students’ details are recorded in a file and in the system as well. The recorded file contains information such as ID, roll number, name, department, date, and time of entrance, and attendance status of recognized 
students. 
The protection of student’s details was also improved with the use of a face recognition 
device. The unknown individual tag is immediately given when unidentified students try to enter 
an educational institution. The multiple faces of students can be identified and recognized.
